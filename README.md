# Automating contracts Scoring for companies

## Introduction

This is a simple code in python used to depict some concepts around the designing and development of software.

This code simulates a process from fictitious company ABC, from the definition of the criteria to score a quotation, passing through populating the purchase process, to the display of the results of providers selected by purchase process.

## 1. Unified Modeling Language (UML)

In this section, I will show some UML diagrams used for explaining to other people the sowftare elements for this excercise and also some sofwtare's behaviors. It is an excellent set of notation elements that help us to model business processes and linking them to our software.

In this excercise, I used [Visual Paradigm](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/) Community Edition v16.1 as the tool for creating these diagrams.

### Use Case Diagram

The following diagram shows how different type of users interact with the software.

## 2. Metrics

For the metrics, I use [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/) and connect this tool with GitHub.
